# Mirror
Mirror, Mirror on the Screen!

## Challenge
Apple Industries is working with an exciting new reflective display screen in our latest line of photo
booths.  While the screen itself is cool, its reflective qualities mean we need to build our displays
backwards, including the text!  To accommodate this, we’ll need some software that can take a
sentence and reverse the order of the words.

## Running the Application
In an IDE run the MirrorApplication class

## Implementation
This project will reverse the words in any sentence provided provided in an HTTP GET Request.
To really give this a mirror feeling I also moved the punctuation to the begining of the mirrored words

## Test
Open a console in the home directory of this project and run mvn test
